# Flower?
iOS App Development Project


I implemented Machine Learning and Object Oriented iOS Developement while creating this app. I converted a machine learning model from Python and coverted it into a CoreML model. Then, I created an app that can help you identify any type of flower, from your photo library or camera. 


Required ML Model can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aKG7tkA1BCp-VTt92QGlhu44VHIT9w5E/view?usp=sharing and needs to be dragged and dropped inside the Xcode.
