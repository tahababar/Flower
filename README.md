# Flower?
iOS App Development Project


I implemented Machine Learning and Object Oriented iOS Developement while creating this app. I converted a machine learning model from Python and coverted it into a CoreML model. Then, I created an app that can help you identify any type of flower, from your photo library or camera. 


Required ML Model can be downloaded from:      and needs to be dragged and dropped inside the Xcode.
